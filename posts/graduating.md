# "Graduating"

As of a few days ago, I have submitted my last 
assessment at the University of New South Wales (UNSW).
My marks indicate I have passed my final (and only one this term)
course (Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology), and
given I have enough to pass (I am **very** ethical), I technically
have finished my degree!


&nbsp;

However, it didn't really feel like a big achievement!
So I began to do reflection upon why (and I think I figured it out), 
so come along (~~leave now while you can~~) for a textbook 
story of "doing too much".


&nbsp;

Over the last four years worn many "hats"[^1] at UNSW, arguably too many[^2].
I've managed to volunteer in the following positions: 
  - Arc Wellness.
  - Organise social events for UNSW CSESoc[^3] (csesoc) (2019 - 2020).
  - Organise social events for UNSW Co-op Society[^4] (co-op soc) (2019 - 2020).
  - Executive Secretary for co-op soc (2020 - 2021).
  - Organise social events for my church on campus (2020 - 2021).
  - Focus on CSE Student wellbeing as the student network director (2020 - 2021).
  - Lead a team of ~100 as Co-President and Grievance Officer of csesoc[^5] (2021 - 2022).
  - Support the projects and development of csesoc as development lead (2022 - pres).
  - Represent the cse student body as student representitive (2020 - pres).  
  - Other things I've forgotten (soz).


&nbsp;

That's,,, a lot. And definitely too much. However, early in my degree, my hubris knew no bounds,
I was constantly looking for new opportunties to help shape the student experience
but this time, as UNSW Staff: 
  - UNSW Co-op Ambassador (2020 - 2022).
  - COMP1511 lab assistant (2020 - 2021).  
  - COMP1511 tutor (2021 - 2022).
  - COMP1511 course administrator (2021 - 2022). 
  - COMP1521 developer (mipsy web [^6] shennanigans).
  - Proposing, Writing and Teaching a new course, COMP6991 (with insou22, tfpk).
  - Casual Academic Representative (2021 - 2022).
  - UNSW Global Lab assistant. 
  - UNSW Global course administrator. 
  - Other miscellaneous cse staff roles.



&nbsp;

Despite appearances, I constantly had troubles balancing it all[^7], alongside
working fulltime jobs on my UNSW Co-op IT placements, relationships and family
commitments.


&nbsp;

The more I did staff work (at some point was working 37 [^8] hours a week 
across different UNSW roles, and this was on top of a fulltime job), 
the more I stopped feeling like a student. 
In fact, over the course of 2022 the only courses I did towards my degree
were courses that I knew would only take <10 contact hours over the entire term,
and I even delayed my degree slightly so I could help teach more. 


&nbsp;

Whilst I really enjoyed the majority of my time working for UNSW, 
I did slightly overdo it, and gave up on my "university experience" 
quite early. I think COVID helped enable this (I was locked up, what else would I do!![^9]).
For future endeavours, I'm going to try focusing on doing a few things well, and prioritsation 
of my own wellbeing over maximising impact for a short period of time.  


&nbsp;

I do have many feelings, thoughts and opinions on my time as a 
casual for UNSW CSE, the future of teaching at CSE, and 
the student experience - but that's for another post :)


&nbsp;

Anyways,
Thanks for reading :)
